# Plex Recommendations AI

## Currently, a work in progress

This project involves creating a 'Recommended' collection on your Plex server using the power of OpenAI. 
By analyzing your unique watch history, it will provide you with personalized suggestions that perfectly align with your preferred genre. 
With this feature, you'll easily discover a handful of delightful recommendations from your extensive movie list, making it a breeze to find your next enjoyable watch!

## Todo
- Dockerise!
- Implement individual user collections (if possible?)
- Create more configurable options cater the movie list.
